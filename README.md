# Arduino Synth Orchestra - The Basics

This repository is a collection of all the sketches used during the introduction workshops on how to make noise with Arduino.
The workshops have been run in various formats and under various names: Arduino Synth Orchestra, Making noise with Arduino, Genuino Synth Orchestra.

This material includes Arduino sketches and Fritzing files that will guide you from blinking an LED to creating a 4 Step Sequencer sound generator tackling most of the Arduino basics from an electronics and coding perspective.

To open and use the files you will need to download and install this software:
+ Arduino IDE https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
+ Fritzing http://fritzing.org/download/

All the content is in the public domain and published under a üç∫ Beerware üç∫ license https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beerware

Have fun using and abusing the code at your own risk to learn more about making noise with the Arduino platform and to create your Arduino based synthesizers.
